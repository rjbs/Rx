<h2 id='why-rx'>Why Rx?</h2>

<p>
  When adding an API to your web service, you have to choose how to encode
  the data you send across the line.  <a
  href='http://www.w3.or/XML/'>XML</a> is one common choice for this, but it
  can grow arcane and cumbersome pretty quickly.  Lots of webservice authors
  want to avoid thinking about XML, and instead choose formats that provide a
  few simple data types that correspond to common data structures in modern
  programming languages.  In other words, <a href='http://json.org/'>JSON</a>
  and <a href='http://yaml.org/'>YAML</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, while these formats make it easy to pass around complex data
  structures, they lack a system for validation.  XML has <a
  href='http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema'>XML Schemas</a> and <a
  href='http://relaxng.org/'>RELAX NG</a>, but these are complicated and
  sometimes confusing standards.  They're not very portable to the kind of
  data structure provided by JSON, and if you wanted to avoid XML as a data
  encoding, writing more XML to validate the first XML is probably even less
  appealing.
</p>

<p>
  Rx is meant to provide a system for data validation that matches up with
  JSON-style data structures and is as easy to work with as JSON itself.

<h2 id='example'>Simple Example</h2>

<div class='sample toggle'>
<pre class='yaml'>
---
type: //rec
required:
  from: //str
  to  : 
    type  : //arr
    length: { min: 1 }
    contents: { type: //str }
  subj: //str
  body: //str
optional:
  user: /example.com/account</pre>
<pre class='json'>
{
  "type": "//rec",
  "required": {
    "from": "//str",
    "to"  : {
      "type"    : "//arr",
      "length"  : { "min": 1 },
      "contents": { "type": "//str" }
    },
    "subj": "//str",
    "body": "//str"
  },
  "optional": {
    "user": "/example.com/account"
  }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  This sample shows a schema to validate a simple data structure composed of
  a map (a hash, dict, js Object, or the like) with at least four and maybe
  five entries.  Each entry in the map has its own schema for validation,
  even though some of the schemata are as simple as "must be a string."

<h2 id='using'>Using Rx</h2>
<p>
  Right now, implementations of Rx have been written in Perl, JavaScript, Ruby,
  Python, and PHP.  Since Rx itself is still undergoing design refinements,
  relying on any implementation in production would be a bad idea.  You can
  find them and play with them in <a
  href='http://github.com/rjbs/rx'>their git repository</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='hacking'>Hacking on Rx</h2>
<p>
  One of Rx's strengths is its simplicity.  It should be easy to implement in
  any language into which JSON can be easily loaded, and one of its design
  goals was to keep its core types simple to implement on any such language.
  The core tests for proving the acceptability of an Rx implementation are
  written in JSON, so new implementations need only write a loader and runner
  for the test suite.
