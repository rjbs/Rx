<p>
  There are really only two things you need to know about in Rx: types and
  schemata.  A type is an abstract description of a type of data.  For
  example, "an integer" or "an associative array" are data types.  When they're
  made into concrete, checkable constraints, they become schemata.  This is
  done by parameterizing them.
</p>

<p>
  A Rx type is identified by a unique URL, generally in the <a
  href='http://taguri.org/'><tt>tag:</tt></a> schema.  When writing these in
  schema definitions, there is a form of shorthand available.  If the string
  begins with a slash, it is assumed to be in the format:
  <tt>/<em>id</em>/<em>rest</em></tt>, where <em>id</em> is in a list of known
  identifiers that expand to base URLs.
</p>

<p>
  For example, given this prefix table:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td class='prefix'>rubric</td><td>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rubric/</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='prefix'>x</td>     <td>http://example.com/x-ample/</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  ...then type names may be supplied as <tt>/rubric/tag</tt> or <tt>/x/int</tt>
  instead of <tt>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rubric/tag</tt> or
  <tt>http://example.com/x-ample/tag</tt> respectively.
</p>

<p>
  The empty prefix is always reserved for the core type tag prefix:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td class='prefix'>(empty)</td><td>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rx/core/</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Types located under <tt>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rx/core/</tt> are the
  <em>core types</em> and must be implemented by all Rx implementations.  These
  are detailed below.  While users can define their own custom types, quite a
  lot of data validation rules can be expressed using the core types.
</p>

<p>
  Prefixes starting with a period are reserved for use by Rx.  The following
  are defined:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td class='prefix'>.rx</td>  <td>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rx/</td></tr>
  <tr><td class='prefix'>.meta</td><td>tag:codesimply.com,2008:rx/meta/</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  This page gives a brief overview of the core types, which will be defined
  in detail elsewhere, later.
</p>

<h2 id='single'>Single Types</h2>

<p>
  The basic scalar (one-value) types are:
</p>

<table class='types'>
  <tr>
    <th>//nil</th>
    <td>the lack of a value (undef, null, nil, etc)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//def</th>
    <td>any defined value; anything that is not //nil</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//bool</th><td>a value that is either true or false</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//num</th><td>a number; may be parameterized by a range</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//int</th>
    <td>an integer; any number such that <tt>(x == floor(x))</tt>; may be
  parameterized by a range</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//str</th>
    <td>a string, even the empty string</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//one</th>
    <td>any single value -- anything //def that is not a collection</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id='collect'>Collection Types</h2>
<p>
  The basic collection (many-value) types are:
</p>

<table class='types'>
  <tr>
    <th>//arr</th>
    <td>a list of values all of one type; may be parameterized by length</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//seq</th>
    <td>a list of values of varying types; each slot has a schema</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//rec</th>
    <td>a record of named entries, each with its own schema</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//map</th>
    <td>a map of names to values, with all the values matching one schema</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id='combo'>Combination Types</h2>

<p>
  The basic combination types are:
</p>

<table class='types'>
  <tr>
    <th>//any</th>
    <td>either anything at all, or any of a given list of schemata</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>//all</th>
    <td>a list of schemata; checked data must validate against them all</td>
  </tr>
</table>
