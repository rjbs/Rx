<h2 id='data-not-strs'>Only for JSON?</h2>
<p>
  Rx isn't only for JSON.  It's just that JSON is a very good least common
  denominator for common datatypes, and using JSON for the reference tests
  makes it very easy to implement elsewhere -- there are JSON implementations
  nearly oheverywhere.
</p>

<p>
  Rx is all about data structures, not the mechanism you used to transport
  them.  It doesn't know about JSON, YAML, XML, or any other way to serialize
  or exchange data.  There are a few unfortunate exceptions, though.  For
  example, because Perl has no native boolean type, it relies on encountering
  the kind of object that a JSON deserializer would create.  These exceptions
  are always about language constraints, and never about Rx itself.
</p>

<p>
  In short, Rx validates data, not JSON strings.
</p>

<h2 id='why-not-use'>Why not use ... ?</h2>
<p>
  There are other systems for validating simple data structures, of course.
  Rx was only written after the other available systems proved inadequate.
</p>

<p>
  XML-centric systems like XSD and RELAX NG had a few problems, but the biggest
  was that they were made for validating data as represented in XML, which
  tends to be different than (or a subset of) the data representations found in
  JSON, YAML, or just in program code.  Even if this wasn't a problem, there
  just aren't enough simple implementations of these validators.

<p>
  <a href='http://www.kuwata-lab.com/kwalify/'>Kwalify</a> was designed as a
  schema system for YAML, but its design has portability issues.  For example,
  it allows regular expressions, the implementation of which differ between
  platforms.  Its implementation of "mapping merging" requires references,
  which are not a feature of JSON, and no system for emulating them in JSON is
  given.  This means that a Kwalify schema might not be representable in JSON,
  which is a shame, since JSON is far more widely-implemented than YAML.  Its
  Ruby implementation includes its own YAML parser, which doesn't conform to
  current YAML specs.  There are other problems, too.
</p>

<p>
  <a href='http://json-schema.org/'>JSON Schema</a> is fairly similar in
  conception to Rx, but is more complex to implement and is less
  straightforward to safely extend with more types.  It does offer some
  features that Rx does not, like subclassing and references.
